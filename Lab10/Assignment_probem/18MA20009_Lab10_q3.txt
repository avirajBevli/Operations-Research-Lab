Enter the number of jobs: 4
Enter the number of operators: 5

This is not a Balanced Assignment problem, will have to make it balanced by introducing dummy variables!

Enter job-operator cost table (cell in the ith row and jth column represents the cost of assignment of ith job to the jth operator): 
57 33 22 31 98
97 59 22 45 7
56 63 33 84 90
43 97 11 71 96

//////////Phase 2 (Optimzation of the problem) -> 
Done Row scanning
Cell (4,0) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 4, 
Marked cols: 2, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,2), (1,4), (4,0), 

Number of marked cells are 3, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (0,3), its val: 9

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
   26     2     0     0    76 
   81    43    15    29     0 
   14    21     0    42    57 
   23    77     0    51    85 
    0     0     9     0     9 

Done Row scanning
Cell (0,3) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 0, 4, 
Marked cols: 2, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,3), (1,4), (2,2), (4,0), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (2,0), its val: 14

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
   26     2    14     0    90 
   67    29    15    15     0 
    0     7     0    28    57 
    9    63     0    37    85 
    0     0    23     0    23 

Done Row scanning
Cell (2,0) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Cell (2,0) identified as a zero not covered with lines
Done Row scanning
Since all the zeros are already covered with lines, no need to do column scanning
Marked rows: 4, 
Marked cols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,3), (1,4), (2,0), (3,2), (4,1), 

Number of marked cells are 5, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has been obtained since num_rows is equal to num_cells_marked. Returning optimal solution!

Only one optimal setting exists for this problem, which is given by
In the optimal solution, jobs have been allocated to operators as: 
Job 0 is assigned to operator 3 with cost 31
Job 1 is assigned to operator 4 with cost 7
Job 2 is assigned to operator 0 with cost 56
Job 3 is assigned to operator 2 with cost 11
Job 4 is assigned to operator 1 with cost 0 {DUMMY}

Hence, optimal total cost is 105
