Enter the number of jobs: 5
Enter the number of operators: 5

This is a Balanced Assignment problem

Enter job-operator cost table (cell in the ith row and jth column represents the cost of assignment of ith job to the jth operator):

//////////Phase 1 -> 
Min row elements are: 15, 18, 1, 27, 14,

//////////Phase 2 (Optimzation of the problem) -> 
Done Row scanning
Cell (3,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 3, 4, 
Marked cols: 0, 2, 
Marked zeros: (0,0), (1,2), (3,1), (4,3), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (1,4), its val: 7

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
    0     5     3    34     4 
    0     2     0    55     0

   20     0    33     0    44 
   86    13    70     0     0 

Done Row scanning
Cell (1,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 1, 3, 4, 
Marked cols: 0, 
Marked zeros: (0,0), (1,2), (3,1), (4,3), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (0,2), its val: 3

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
    0     2     0    31     1 
    3     2     0    55     0 
    0    15    74    24     8 
   23     0    33     0    44 
   89    13    70     0     0 

Done Row scanning
Cell (0,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Cell (0,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
Done Row scanning
Since all the zeros are already covered with lines, no need to do column scanning
Marked rows: 1, 3, 4, 
Marked cols: 0, 2, 3, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,2), (1,4), (2,0), (3,1), (4,3), 

Number of marked cells are 5, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has been obtained since num_rows is equal to num_cells_marked. Returning optimal solution!

Only one optimal setting exists for this problem, which is given by
In the optimal solution, jobs have been allocated to operators as: 
Job 0 is assigned to operator 2 with cost 19
Job 1 is assigned to operator 4 with cost 53
Job 2 is assigned to operator 0 with cost 1
Job 3 is assigned to operator 1 with cost 86
Job 4 is assigned to operator 3 with cost 14

Hence, optimal total cost is 173
