Enter the number of jobs: 5
Enter the number of operators: 5

This is a Balanced Assignment problem

Enter job-operator cost table (cell in the ith row and jth column represents the cost of assignment of ith job to the jth operator): 
9 11 14 11 7
6 15 13 13 10
12 13 6 8 8
11 9 10 12 9
7 12 14 10 14


//////////////////////
The job-operator cost tableau(INPUT) is: 
    9    11    14    11     7 
    6    15    13    13    10 
   12    13     6     8     8 
   11     9    10    12     9 
    7    12    14    10    14 

//////////Phase 1 -> 
Min row elements are: 7, 6, 6, 9, 7, 
Done row reductions, the new mat is -> 
    2     4     7     4     0 
    0     9     7     7     4 
    6     7     0     2     2 
    2     0     1     3     0 
    0     5     7     3     7 

Min col elements are: 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 
Done column reductions, the new mat is -> 
    2     4     7     2     0 
    0     9     7     5     4 
    6     7     0     0     2 
    2     0     1     1     0 
    0     5     7     1     7 


//////////Phase 2 (Optimzation of the problem) -> 
Done Row scanning
Cell (2,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 2, 
Marked cols: 0, 1, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,4), (1,0), (2,2), (3,1), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (3,2), its val: 1

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
    2     4     6     1     0 
    0     9     6     4     4 
    7     8     0     0     3 
    2     0     0     0     0 
    0     5     6     0     7 

Done Row scanning
Cell (2,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 2, 3, 
Marked cols: 0, 3, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,4), (1,0), (2,2), (3,1), (4,3), 

Number of marked cells are 5, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has been obtained since num_rows is equal to num_cells_marked. Returning optimal solution!

Only one optimal setting exists for this problem, which is given by
In the optimal solution, jobs have been allocated to operators as: 
Job 0 is assigned to operator 4 with cost 7
Job 1 is assigned to operator 0 with cost 6
Job 2 is assigned to operator 2 with cost 6
Job 3 is assigned to operator 1 with cost 9
Job 4 is assigned to operator 3 with cost 10

Hence, optimal total cost is 38
