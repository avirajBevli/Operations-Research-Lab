Enter the number of jobs: 5
Enter the number of operators: 4

This is not a Balanced Assignment problem, will have to make it balanced by introducing dummy variables!

Enter job-operator cost table (cell in the ith row and jth column represents the cost of assignment of ith job to the jth operator): 
85 70 65 68
93 57 37 97
24 20 25 23
6 1 89 84
10 19 77 38

//////////Phase 2 (Optimzation of the problem) -> 
Done Row scanning
Cell (2,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 2, 3, 
Marked cols: 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,4), (2,2), (3,0), 

Number of marked cells are 3, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (4,0), its val: 4

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
   75    65    36    41     0 
   83    52     8    70     0 
   18    19     0     0     4 
    0     0    64    61     4 
    0    14    48    11     0 

Done Row scanning
Cell (2,2) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 2, 3, 
Marked cols: 0, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,4), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (1,2), its val: 8

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
   75    57    28    33     0 
   83    44     0    62     0 
   26    19     0     0    12 
    8     0    64    61    12 
    0     6    40     3     0 

Done Row scanning
Since all the zeros are already covered with lines, no need to do column scanning
Marked rows: 
Marked cols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
Marked zeros: (0,4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,0), 

Number of marked cells are 5, Number of rows are 5
Optimality has been obtained since num_rows is equal to num_cells_marked. Returning optimal solution!

Only one optimal setting exists for this problem, which is given by
In the optimal solution, jobs have been allocated to operators as: 
Job 0 is assigned to operator 4 with cost 0 {DUMMY}
Job 1 is assigned to operator 2 with cost 37
Job 2 is assigned to operator 3 with cost 23
Job 3 is assigned to operator 1 with cost 1
Job 4 is assigned to operator 0 with cost 10

Hence, optimal total cost is 71
