Enter the number of jobs: 4
Enter the number of operators: 4

This is a Balanced Assignment problem

Enter job-operator cost table (cell in the ith row and jth column represents the cost of assignment of ith job to the jth operator): 
8 5 6 2
7 2 1 3
9 7 4 2
9 8 9 6


//////////////////////
The job-operator cost tableau(INPUT) is: 
    8     5     6     2 
    7     2     1     3 
    9     7     4     2 
    9     8     9     6 

//////////Phase 1 -> 
Min row elements are: 2, 1, 2, 6, 
Done row reductions, the new mat is -> 
    6     3     4     0 
    6     1     0     2 
    7     5     2     0 
    3     2     3     0 

Min col elements are: 3, 1, 0, 0, 
Done column reductions, the new mat is -> 
    3     2     4     0 
    3     0     0     2 
    4     4     2     0 
    0     1     3     0 


//////////Phase 2 (Optimzation of the problem) -> 
Done Row scanning
Cell (1,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 1, 
Marked cols: 0, 3, 
Marked zeros: (0,3), (1,1), (3,0), 

Number of marked cells are 3, Number of rows are 4
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (3,1), its val: 1

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
    3     1     3     0 
    4     0     0     3 
    4     3     1     0 
    0     0     2     0 

Done Row scanning
Cell (1,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Marked rows: 1, 3, 
Marked cols: 3, 
Marked zeros: (0,3), (1,1), (3,0), 

Number of marked cells are 3, Number of rows are 4
Optimality has not been obtained since num_rows is not equal to num_cells_marked........Continuing iterations

min_undetected_cell : (0,1), its val: 1

After modifying the matrix(add minimum value at the intersection points, subtract minimum value from the undeleted cells), the mat now becomes: 
    2     0     2     0 
    4     0     0     4 
    3     2     0     0 
    0     0     2     1 

Done Row scanning
Cell (0,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Cell (0,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
Done Row scanning
Cell (0,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
All the zeros are not covered with lines, hence Doing column scanning
Done Col scanning
Cell (0,1) identified as a zero not covered with lines
Since even after row, column scanning, there are some zeros not covered with lines, means this is the ALTERNATE OPTIMUM CONDITION
We will use random Diagonal selection to break the tie arbitratily
Marked rows: 3, 
Marked cols: 1, 2, 3, 
Marked zeros: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,0), 

Number of marked cells are 4, Number of rows are 4
Optimality has been obtained since num_rows is equal to num_cells_marked. Returning optimal solution!

Multiple optimal settings exist for this problem, one of which is the following 
In the optimal solution, jobs have been allocated to operators as: 
Job 0 is assigned to operator 1 with cost 5
Job 1 is assigned to operator 2 with cost 1
Job 2 is assigned to operator 3 with cost 2
Job 3 is assigned to operator 0 with cost 9

Hence, optimal total cost is 17
